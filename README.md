### Advent of Code!

I'm Noah and here is my first GitHub repository.
If you see this file on my project, it's because I'm learning Git.

I've decided to try my hand at this year's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) as a beginner Python developer. I am still learning Python, so there is a ton of room for improvement! I'm learning a ton every day, and I hope I can improve and solidify my skills by attempting these fun challenges.

Thanks for reading!
